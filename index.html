    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>
    I’ve been playing piano since very young, and it’s been a huge loving interest for me since. I’m not an expert yet but in training to become it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I draw sometimes, hopefully I’ll take some classes to improve in a future.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love reading, most of my time is spent on a good book and a cup of tea (or coffee, depends on the occasion). Classics will always have my heart as favorites, I’ve always preferred mostly antique or more-than-a-century-old classics than modern ones, though all are great.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love writing, whether it is just a silly small draft of emotional-dumps or even the sudden planning of a future book I’d wish to write. Sure, I still have a lot to work for it, but I love the feeling writing emits, the tranquility and excitement to come up with the most absurd ideas and make them look fantastic, I’d love to even learn to write proper poems someday soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also like small papercrafts, they're simple but they keep me entertained for hours (:

  <h1>Dreams</h1>
   <p>
   Going way far in the future, I’m hoping and planning to live somewhere in England (Brighton perhaps, it’s a lovely place) and I aspire to be a writer, or perhaps a director in cinematographic arts. (Or that extremely odd dream of mine of playing at least once in my life on a theatre, whether for a musical or anything of the sorts). Back to present though, I hope to do well both on Cambridge/Oxford’s essay competition and the British English Olympics (BEO) I’ll be participating further in 2023.

  <h1>Recommendations</h1>
  <h2>Places</h2>
  <p>
  for those who love warm places, I highly recommend Aruba, it’s a small island with very nice shops, and the ocean is incredibly clear and blue, it’s a breathtaking scene. I will always recommend trying to save up and plan a trip to Europe at least once in your life, as an example Italy and Germany, the statues and architecture of antique buildings with such importance are something I’d love to see again for the first time.

  <h2>Books</h2>
  <p>
  I will forever and always recommend classics. Sure, they may be a little hard to comprehend at first since it’s a more elegant and old writing style (descriptive, bla bla bla), but the emotions and scenery are always incredibly well written, sticks with you forever no matter if theyre a century old or just from a decade ago. I'd recommend Before The Coffee Gets Cold, its short and includes a total of 4 stories based on time-traveling to change the past, it has a way to get you hooked and sentimental.

  <h2>Movies/Series</h2>
  <p>
  I’m a big fan of analog and psychological horror series and movies. It portrays a better-made horror genre that not only keeps you waiting, but highly focused hence you’ll never know what could come by to the screen. I’d recommend movies such as The Crimson Peak, Eli or Midsommar (these are very gorey, please check warnings before even considering on watching.)
